        <h2>Why We're Here</h2>
        <p>
            Fire Emblem is one of my favorite game franchises of all time and I was ecstatic when I found out there was going to be a mobile game that gave me access to
            my favorite characters anytime, anywhere.  A lot has happened since the release of the game and I thought I would take the time to go over some of my Favorite
            units as well as the builds I am currently running on them. I also want to showcase my +10 units (yes there will be some overlap).
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, due to the current state of the game, I will have a section devoted to what I think are the most oppressive units running around in different game
            modes and why.  Finally, The Hall of Infamy will focus on units that used to be meta relevant but have fallen off as the game has powercrept them into oblivion.
        </p>
        <p>
            May the Goddess be with you!
        </p>
